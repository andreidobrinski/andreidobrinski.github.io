    <Body>I&apos;ve taken on several UX roles at LifeTales, as designers at startups usually do, all while seeking to understand how users interact with the product. These responsibilities included:</Body>
    <ul>
      <ListItem>UX research with user testing and surveys.</ListItem>
      <ListItem>High-fidelity UI design for screens.</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Wireframing user flows.</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Designing logic for when to ask users for standard iOS permissions.</ListItem>
    </ul>
    <Body>I conducted UX research both independently and as part of a design team at LifeTales. The research included:</Body>
    <ul>
      <ListItem>Video-recorded user testing sessions of the onboarding and story interaction experience.</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Hallway user testing of specific features or sections of the app.</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Interviews with members of the target market.</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Composing and sending out surveys to test interest in potential new features.</ListItem>
    </ul>
    <Body>User testing was a positive experience for learning pain points in the UX flows, as well as hearing users&apos; responses to our value proposition. These tests gave me valuable information to consider while designing flows and information architecture, and an understanding of what users value in the app.</Body>
    <Body>I used prototypes to conduct user tests of new features, as well as testing the prototype against the current app to see which version provided a better experience for the user. For the user tests, I designed the screens in Sketch, used Invision for flow-based prototypes, and used Swift/Xcode for more interaction-based prototypes.</Body>
    <Body>
      I also designed, animated, and wrote the script for

      that we used in our marketing materials.
    </Body>
    <Body>I was also involved with the strategic side of design - how LifeTales fits in to the competitive market and how to categorize the value propositions of the app. I designed a framework to group different use cases of the app at a high-level, to understand how the user comes into the app, why they do it, and how long they spend in their sessions. In addition, I wrote competitive analyses of companies with similar offerings to LifeTales, to help guide the positioning and strategy of LifeTales.</Body>
    <Body>My experiences as a UX designer has helped me to be a better web developer. By understanding the intersection of business goals, how users interact with the product and the technology powering it, Iâ€™ve been able to make better decisions about tackling problems in a lean manner.</Body>
