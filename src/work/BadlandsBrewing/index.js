    <h1>Designing a logo for an Ontario craft brewery.</h1>
    <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
    <p>
      Badlands Brewing Company needed a logo that would be suitable for bottle labels, kegs, taps,
      glasses, and merchandise. The logo needed to be simple enough to be printed on the different mediums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Badlands Brewing started in Caledon, Ontario - near the Cheltenham Badlands. The brand wanted an
      aesthetic that would fit the rugged, natural environment of the Badlands that inspired them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My task was to design a unique and iconic logo that would identify the
      Badlands Brewing brand in the competitive beer industry.
    </p>
    <h2>The Stack</h2>
    <p>Adobe Illustrator</p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>
      Coming up with an image that represented the Cheltenham Badlands while also giving the brand an
      identifying logo was initally a challenge. The Badlands are known for their sweaping landscapes but
      the brand needed an image that would be multi-functional.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to choose an owl as this could serve as both a logo and a mascot for the brand.
      For the design I was inspired by&nbsp;
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Kaepora_Gaebora">this owl</a>
      &nbsp;from The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time. As a nocturnal animal,
      it would be something beer-drinking night owls could relate to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Designing the logo took several iterations. The owl needed to resemble both the beauty and grit of the
      Badlands, while being recognizable in the craft beer market. Following this idea was the pronounced
      sterness of the owl's face, as well as the mixture of sharp and rounded edges throughout the body.
      Below is the final design.

    <h2>The Learning</h2>
    <p>
      This project was an interesting challenge as it taught me useful technical knowledge about using
      Illustrator and about creating a unique identity for a brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project was an interesting challenge as it expanded both my technical knowledge of
      Illustrator and my knowledge of branding in a competitive market.
    </p>
    <p>
      My final design for the owl's wings started to take shape when I began using using the Simplify Path
      feature in Illustrator. This was the first project where I was using the feature and
      I felt that it fit the brewery's aesthetic well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed the challenge of symbolizing the Badlands environment and the process
      of making the design a reality.
